# MV-Plugins

RPG Maker MV is a fun software tool that allows anyone to create their own RPG games without requiring programming knowledge and is extendable via a plugin system.

From a technical standpoint, the game engine runs a node.js server and runs the game's code through it. Hence, plugins for RPG Maker MV are written in JavaScript.
